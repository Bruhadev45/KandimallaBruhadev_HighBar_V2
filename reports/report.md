## Detailed Hypotheses

### H1
**Status**: partially_confirmed
**Confidence**: 78.00%

While UGC and Image creatives show higher ROAS and CTR compared to Video, Carousel creatives also perform well, suggesting that the claim is not entirely exclusive to UGC and Image. The evidence supports a trend but is not definitive across all creative types.

### H2
**Status**: confirmed
**Confidence**: 82.00%

The low CTR and high impressions for these campaigns strongly suggest audience saturation. The evidence aligns well with the hypothesis, indicating a significant issue with engagement.

### H3

**Confidence**: 76.00%

The low ROAS and CTR, coupled with high spend, suggest poor message-market fit. However, without qualitative insights into the messaging strategy, the conclusion remains partially speculative.
